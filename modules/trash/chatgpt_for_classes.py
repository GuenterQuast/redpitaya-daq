To create a class in Python that accepts a configuration dictionary during initialization and restricts access to methods based on specific entries in the dictionary, you can follow these steps:

1. **Initialize the class with a configuration dictionary**.
2. **Check for required entries in the dictionary during method calls**.
3. **Use decorators to handle access control**.

Here is a clean and organized way to implement this:

```python
class ConfigError(Exception):
    """Custom exception to raise when configuration is invalid."""
    pass

def requires_keys(*required_keys):
    """Decorator to ensure required keys are present in the configuration."""
    def decorator(method):
        def wrapper(self, *args, **kwargs):
            if not all(key in self.config for key in required_keys):
                missing_keys = [key for key in required_keys if key not in self.config]
                raise ConfigError(f"Missing required config keys: {', '.join(missing_keys)}")
            return method(self, *args, **kwargs)
        return wrapper
    return decorator

class MyClass:
    def __init__(self, config):
        self.config = config

    @requires_keys('key1')
    def method1(self):
        print("Method1 executed. Key1 is present.")

    @requires_keys('key2')
    def method2(self):
        print("Method2 executed. Key2 is present.")

    @requires_keys('key1', 'key2')
    def method3(self):
        print("Method3 executed. Both Key1 and Key2 are present.")

# Example usage
config = {'key1': 'value1', 'key2': 'value2'}

obj = MyClass(config)
obj.method1()  # Output: Method1 executed. Key1 is present.
obj.method2()  # Output: Method2 executed. Key2 is present.
obj.method3()  # Output: Method3 executed. Both Key1 and Key2 are present.

# Example with missing keys
config_incomplete = {'key1': 'value1'}
obj_incomplete = MyClass(config_incomplete)
obj_incomplete.method1()  # Output: Method1 executed. Key1 is present.
try:
    obj_incomplete.method2()  # Raises ConfigError: Missing required config key: key2
except ConfigError as e:
    print(e)
```

### Explanation:

1. **ConfigError Exception**: This custom exception is raised when the required configuration keys are missing.
2. **requires_keys Decorator**: This decorator checks if the specified keys are present in the configuration dictionary before allowing the method to execute. If the keys are missing, it raises a `ConfigError`.
3. **MyClass Initialization**: The class is initialized with a configuration dictionary. The methods `method1`, `method2`, and `method3` are decorated with `@requires_keys` to specify which keys are required in the configuration for each method to be accessible.

### Advantages:

- **Separation of Concerns**: The decorator handles the access control logic, keeping the methods clean and focused on their primary responsibilities.
- **Reusability**: The `requires_keys` decorator can be reused for any method that needs to check for specific configuration entries.
- **Readability**: The use of decorators makes it clear which configuration keys are required for each method.
