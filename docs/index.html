<p>Data acquisition for the <a href="https://redpitaya.com/de/">RedPitaya FPGA board</a> for physics laboratory courses</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/GuenterQuast/redpitaya-daq"> Link to repository</a> </p>

<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>The RedPitaya is a small, credit-card sized single board computer with a
  dual-core ARM Cortex-A processor and a XILINX Zynq 7010 FPGA. The board
  contains two fast ADCs and two DACs with 14 bit resolution running at a
  sampling frequency of 125 MHz. Extension connectors provide general purpose
  IO pins with slow analog inputs and outputs and support for serial bus
  interfaces like IÂ²C, SPI and UART. The system runs under Linux, which
  provides network access and supports a wide range of applications running on
  the board. Many laboratory instruments like oscilloscopes, logic analyzers, Bode
  plotters or a multi-channel pulse-height analyzer can be realized on this
  board by simply changing the FPGA image and the Linux application.
</p>
<p>The MCPHA application for the RedPitaya by Pavel Demin provides a
  multi-channel pulse-height analyzer as well as an oscilloscope capable of
  transferring large data rates reaching the theoretical limit of the one-Gbit
  ethernet port. The package consists of an FPGA image and a server process
  running on the RedPitaya board. A client script controls the server and
  pulls the data to the client computer.
</p>
<p>This package extends the original client by a possibility to record or
 export waveform data and provides helper scripts to read back and analyze the
 recorded data. An interface to the buffer manager <em>mimoCoRB</em> for
  buffering and parallel processing of large date volumes is also provided.
</p>

<p>The *redpitaya-daq* package is in use for gamma-ray spectroscopy
  experiments in physics laboratory courses at the Faculty of Physics at
  Karlsruhe Institute of Technology.

<h2 id="credit">Credit:</h2>
<p>
  The code prvided here is based on a fork of the
  sub-directory <em>projects/mcpha</em> in a project by Pavel Demin,
  <a href="https://pavel-demin.github.io/red-pitaya-notes">red-pitaya-notes</a>.
  <br>
  <em>redPdaq.py</em> contains an extension of the original oscilloscope class
  enabling fast restart and data export.
</p>

<h2 id="example">Example</h2>
<p>
  The directory <em>examples/</em> of the project contains some spectra
  recorded with <em>redPdaq.py</em> and the Python
  program <em>peakFitter.py</em> to find and precisely fit peaks in
  recorded spectra. An example is shown here:

<h2 id="project-status">Project status</h2>
<p>
This project has been developed for experiments in the physics laboratory 
courses at the Faculty of Physics at Karlsruhe Institute of Technology.
The code is already public, but presently still under test.</p>
