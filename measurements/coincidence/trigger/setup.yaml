# Configuration for recording two channels with mimoCoRB
#  -----------------------------------------------------
#
# configure two buffers:
#  - RB_1 for raw waveforms
#  - RB_2 for derived pulse parameters
#  data from RB_2, the result buffer, are saved to a file in csv (text) format.
#
#  - data from RB_1 are also passed to an obsever process driving a real-time display
#  - data from RB_2 are passed to a Reader process driving a real-time histogram display
#
# Notes:
# 
#    1. additional config files controlling the user functions are
#       located in the subdirectory config/
#    2. necessary application-specific user code is located
#       in the subdirectory modules/

      channel_per_slot: 1000
      data_type:
          1: ['ch1', "int16"]
          2: ['ch2', "int16"]
#   - RB_3:
#       # buffer with correct signature double pulse parameters
#       number_of_slots: 100
#       channel_per_slot: 1
#       data_type:
